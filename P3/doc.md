**Part 3: K3d and Argo CD**

**Introduction:**

This section involves using K3d and Argo CD to manage Kubernetes clusters and automate application deployments.

**Requirements:**

- Docker
- K3d

**Setup:**

1. **Installing K3d Dependencies:**
    - Ensure Docker is installed.
    - [Instructions for Docker installation](docker-installation-link).

2. **Installing K3d:**
    - Follow these steps to install K3d:
      ```bash
      # Example installation command
      curl -s https://get.k3d.io | bash
      ```

3. **Configuring Argo CD:**
    - Set up Argo CD and create namespaces as required.

**Usage:**

1. **Managing Kubernetes Clusters with K3d:**
    - Create a new Kubernetes cluster:
      ```bash
      k3d cluster create my-cluster
      ```
    - List clusters:
      ```bash
      k3d cluster list
      ```
    - Delete a cluster:
      ```bash
      k3d cluster delete my-cluster
      ```

2. **Deploying Applications with Argo CD:**
    - Use Argo CD to deploy applications. Sync applications from the Git repository.

**Git Repository Structure:**

The Git repository should contain configuration files for Argo CD.

**Troubleshooting:**

Check for common issues and solutions. Debug problems related to K3d and Argo CD.
